Game start up image:

The start up image for Internet Defender will be very minimalistic. This to
make sure the player is not overwhelmed before they begin the game. All
the important information is displayed such as number of lives and score.
This mode may be omitted if just starting up the game instead when the
application is open is more convienent.

This image displays a typical game in progress during the early stages.
There is a uniform grid distribution of enemy sprites and the player
is located at the map bottom. Each bunker is evenly spaced and will be 
destroyed after 10 impacts. The enemy sprites also start near the top of the map at the beginning of each respective level.

Mid Game image:

This image displays a typical Mid-game instance of Internet defender. The
enemy sprites can be destroyed in any order and will be sped up
based on how many of them have been destroyed. The bunkers will dissappear
from the map after being shot at 10 times.

Game Over image:

This image will be displayed after either the player runs out of lives
or the enemy sprites reach the bottom of the map. A large text will
display notifying the user that the game has ended and the score will display.
Whether or not it will allow the user to start up a new game will be decided
during development.

The designs will differ from the final product in the exact styling
of the sprites and color scheme. As usually asthetic decisions are made  and 
changed mid development. Also The exactly game map and character sizing may be different 
depending on which size parameters best fit the gameplay. Also depending on time constraints, some asthetics may be left out such as the Legend of Zelda
style health container mechanic. Also certain features such as restarting a
new game after a loss within the same game instance may be omitted depending on
game development.
